# Functionality:

This is my actual first web page, I did this work from scratch to show potential employers my I am capable of. This work will of course be improve in the futrure as my skills grows. For this task I was presented with a set of criterias to follow.

* You are presented with my name, a recent photo, and links to sections about me, my work, and how to contact me.

* When you click on the links in the navigation bar, the UI scrolls to the corresponding section.

* The my-work section includes images of my applications (atm placeholder images) which are titled.

* The first image of the application is larger than the other ones and they all have hover functions.

* When you click on the first/larger image it will take you to the first projects deployed webpage.

* The layout is responsive and adapts to different viewports, such as smartphones and Ipads.
